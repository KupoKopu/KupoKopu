- 👋 Hi, I’m @KupoKopu
- 🌱 I’m currently figuring out what projects to put on github but will start delving into data structures and design templates soon (c++)
- I have meddled in my projects with: C++, C#, WxWidgets, SQL, ODBC, OLE, Python, Flask
- Understand: Python, HTML, Javascript & CSS

<!---
KupoKopu/KupoKopu is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
